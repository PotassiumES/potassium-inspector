# PotassiumES Inspector

This repository holds a WebExtension for web creators using the [PotassiumES](https://potassiumes.org/) wider web application framework.

The main project page is at [PotassiumES.org](https://potassiumes.org/).

So far the tool allows you to:
- quickly switch between flat, portal, and immersive display mode during development
- dump KSS and computed styles for your SOM

You can see an early version of the dev panel [in this demo clip](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/74588c99-7cc7-497b-8471-c13c3411851d)

This is under development and is not yet published to the extension sites.

In the meantime you can load the inspector from disk.

### On Firefox:

	cd potassium-inspector
	zip -r ../potassium-inspector.xpi *

Now drag potassium-inspector.xpi onto any Firefox window

### On Chrome:

Navigate to chrome://extensions/ then click "Load unpacked" and select the potassium-inspector directory.

## Project Goals

**Goal 1:** Enable the wider web

The "wider web" adds augmented and virtual reality to the existing flat web. It incorporates the essential harassment management tools required for healthy social systems.

See [What Is The Wider Web](https://potassiumes.org/wider-web/) for more details.

**Goal 2**: Explore new design, art, and social capabilities

The wider web provides fresh ground to explore new user experience designs, flat graphics, 3D graphics, art forms, and social situations.

This project supports and encourages exploration of these new directions.
