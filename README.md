# PotassiumES Inspector

A WebExtension for web creators using the [PotassiumES](https://potassiumes.org/) wider web application framework.

This is under development and is not ready for general publication.

You can, however, use your browser's dev tools to load the inspector from disk.

The goal of the tool is to quickly quick between flat, portal, and immersive display modes during development. It's often faster to roughly lay out UI using a flat display and then to go into headsets or onto handsets.

You can see an early version of the dev panel [in this demo clip](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/74588c99-7cc7-497b-8471-c13c3411851d)
